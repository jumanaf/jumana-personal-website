          <strong>Key insights:</strong> Dyno therapeutics is a $100M Series A startup, and I have been with the company 
          from when it was 50 employees to today, at ~200 employees. It has been awesome to see a techbio startup scale and 
          expand computational infrastructure. Especially early on in my time at Dyno, I wore multiple hats and worked with 
          engineers and scientists of varying backgrounds, and bridged gaps between pure software engineers and pure biologists 
          to create an accessible and effective internal data science toolkit.

          I had wonderful mentors across the company and led efforts in developing key machine learning models used to deliver antibody libraries for experimentation.

          As a tool to help past me, I built a ML classifier model to classify various colleges and universities across the US to analyze the public sentiment (via Reddit) of 
          a given institution. This was a fun project I worked on during the beginning of my career as a data scientist, but one I look back at fondly, since it inspired me to learn more about 
          data science, machine learning, and software engineering.
