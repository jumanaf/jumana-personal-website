          <strong>Key insights:</strong> This program at UW was highly interdisciplinary, involving 
          computer science, physics, civil and mechanical engineering, medicine, and so on; this enlightened to me the fact that innovation was born from 
          the intersection of various fields of study. I was especially excited about pulling key insights from rich biological data to 
          develop technologies of impact.
