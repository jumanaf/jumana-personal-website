          <strong>Key insights:</strong> Dyno therapeutics is a $100M Series A startup, and I have been with the company 
          from when it was 50 employees to today, at ~200 employees. It has been awesome to see a techbio startup scale and 
          expand computational infrastructure. Especially early on in my time at Dyno, I wore multiple hats and worked with 
          engineers and scientists of varying backgrounds, and bridged gaps between pure software engineers and pure biologists 
          to create an accessible and effective internal data science toolkit.

          <strong>Key insights:</strong> Just-Evotec is a company that focuses on discovery and manufacturing of biological therapeutics. During my time at Just, I focused on their platform J.HAL, a platform
          for humanoid antibody library generation. Just was acquired by Evotec in 2019, and it was definitely interesting to work at a larger scale biotech company after my internship with Dyno, earlier in the year. 
          I had wonderful mentors across the company and led efforts in developing key machine learning models used to deliver antibody libraries for experimentation.

          <strong>Key insights:</strong> As my first internship in techbio, I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Dyno.
           I interacted with folks across the company and picked up key data science and software engineering skills, along with great context into gene therapy and publicly available biological datasets.
           Working with the incredible folks at Dyno inspired me to be scientifically curious, detail oriented, and effective in communication, all key skills for a successful data scientist.
