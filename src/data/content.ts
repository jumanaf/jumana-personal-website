    "I studied bioengineering in the University of Washington, and worked as a data scientist in gene therapy. Now I'm co-founding a robotics startup where I build software, customer experiences, and the underlying infrastructure.",
    'My experiences seem a bit random, but the throughline is the seams: where hardware meets software, where a model meets messy data, where research meets something that has to ship on Tuesday. I like going deep: into a device tree, a single protein in a sequence, the nitty-gritty of an RL parameter.',
